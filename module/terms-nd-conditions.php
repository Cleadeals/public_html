It does not assume ownership of any property or advertisements submitted by Users.
Any content uploaded by Users, such as property descriptions, photographs, or
advertisements, remains the property of the respective User, subject to the rights granted

compliance of any property listing with applicable laws. It is the responsibility of the
User to ensure that all submitted Listings and advertisements comply with all relevant
laws, including but not limited to real estate regulations, local laws, and intellectual
property laws</p>
        <p>3. Third-Party Content
 Some Listings may contain third-party video content, images, or other media ("ThirdParty Content") that Cleardeals hosts or displays. Such Third-Party Content is provided
for general informational purposes only and does not constitute a recommendation,
endorsement, or solicitation for any property or transaction. Cleardeals makes no
representations or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or legality of any ThirdParty Content and shall not be liable for any errors or omissions in the content.

Cleardeals accepts payments through UPI, credit/debit cards, and payment links. For
completing online transactions involving payments, a user will be directed to a Payment
Gateway. Cleardeals does not store or retain any credit card or UPI details. Since the
transaction is processed through a third-party network, once a payment is completed,

finalized at the Payment Gateway. This ensures maximum security for all online
transactions.</p>
        <p>www.cleardeals.co.in Liability Disclaimer

transactions, or their verification process. Cleardeals shall not be held responsible for
any error, omission, or inaccuracy with respect to any information disclosed and used,

        <h3>Refund Policy for Failed Transactions</h3>
        <p>Though Cleardeals payment reconciliation team works on a 24x7 basis, Cleardeals
offers no guarantees whatsoever for the accuracy or timeliness of the refunds reaching
the subscriber's card, bank account, or any other payment method used. This is due to
the involvement of multiple organizations in the processing of online transactions, as
well as issues related to Internet infrastructure, working days/holidays of financial
institutions, and third-party payment processors.</p>
        <p>Refunds in the event of a failed transaction or an erroneous payment will be processed
by Cleardeals at the earliest possible time, but Cleardeals offers no guarantees for the
exact timing of the refunds. The delay in processing may depend on the payment
method, the third-party payment gateway, and the respective financial institution's
processing time.</p>

related to the service, Cleardeals will assess the situation at its sole discretion. Refunds
for such cases will be considered, but they are entirely at the discretion of Cleardeals,
